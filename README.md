This project consists of developing a simplified Trivial (Quiz) game using a client-server architecture with multithreading and relational database persistence (MySQL).

It integrates key concepts from:

Multithreaded programming (Java concurrency)

Client-server communication

Relational database access using JDBC

The result is a more complete and scalable application combining knowledge from both Programming of Services and Processes and Data Access modules.
